# Mondrian Project

This project is a representation of one of Piet Mondrian's art pieces using HTML and CSS. It recreates the composition and color scheme of the artwork in a grid-based layout.

## Description

The Mondrian Project displays a grid layout representing one of Piet Mondrian's art pieces. The grid is created using CSS Grid, and the colors are applied to different grid cells based on the original artwork's composition.

## Piet Mondrian

Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) was a Dutch painter and one of the pioneers of abstract art. He is best known for his distinctive style characterized by geometric shapes, primary colors, and a grid-based composition.

Mondrian's art evolved over time, influenced by movements such as Cubism and De Stijl. He aimed to express the universal principles of harmony and balance through his abstract compositions. His work reflects a reduction to essentials, eliminating representational elements and focusing on geometric forms and color relationships.

## CSS as an Artistic Medium

In this project, CSS is used as a creative medium to recreate Mondrian's art. By leveraging CSS Grid, the project achieves the grid-based composition and applies colors to different grid cells to replicate the original artwork's color scheme.

Using CSS to create art showcases the versatility and expressive possibilities of this web technology. It demonstrates how CSS can be used not only for styling web pages but also for artistic and creative purposes.
